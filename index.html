            TSA is a club where you make a project following a skill and then compete with the project. So far, I've worked
            on projects like a children's story, and this year, I plan on diving into board game design.

        In Cyber Patriot, I'm a third-year Linux team member. My role involves securing a Linux account for a fictitious

        responsibilities included greeting customers, cleaning the lobby, taking orders, managing the self-order
        machines, assembling orders, restocking sauces, and assisting with curbsides and drive-thrus. I worked there for
        a total of 6 months before resigning to focus on schoolwork.

        the 911 Dispatch Center of York. This project was done collaboratively with a friend, and it was fulfilling to
        contribute to something for people who do so much for their community.
